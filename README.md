#Brotli
An iOS and OSX wrapper for Google's [Brotli](https://github.com/google/brotli) project.

### Installation

Simply add the following to your `Cartfile`:
```
github "matthewcheok/Brotli"
```

and then run `carthage update --use-submodules`

### Using Brotli

`Brotli` is both Objective-C and Swift compatible!

Simply import the framework:
```
import Brotli
```

To compress use `func compressedData()` or `func compressedDataWithQuality(quality: UInt)` where `quality` ranges from `1` to `11`.

To decompress use `func decompressedData()`.

Take a look at the playground (in the included workspace) for a more detailed example.

### Comparisons to Gzip (zlib, default compression)

Below are some rough benchmarks on typical JSON content running on a `iPhone 6`. A quality of `5` nets you pretty much equivalent or better results compared to Gzip on average. Increasing the quality trades compression time for better compression ratio and decompression time.
